            <p>Does school prepare children for the real world? "Study hard and get good
                grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits," my parents
                to say. Their goal in life was to provide a college education for my older
                sister and me, so that we would have the greatest chance for success in life. When 
                T finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, and near the
                top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had
                realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In
                accordance with the "Master Plan," I was hired by a "Big 8" accounting firm, and
                I looked forward to a long career and retirement at an early age.
            </p>
            <p>My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hardworking families, 
                of modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but 
                he did it twice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited
                by a prestigious Washington, D.C., law firm that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed 
                bright, career path well defined and early retirement guaranteed.

            <h2>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</h2>
            <h4>October 02, 2020 by Delano Senior</h4>
            <img class="posts" src="image02.jpg" alt="Image of US 1 Dollar Bills">
            <p>I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and
                intelligent; he had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in
                less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of
                Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all on full
                financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth grade. Both 
                men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives.
                Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The
                other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of
                millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church. The other left
                bills to be paid.
            </p>
            <p>Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me
                advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in
                education but did not recommend the same course of study.
                If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice.
                Having two dads advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view;
                one of a rich man and one of a poor man.
